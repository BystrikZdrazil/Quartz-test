# Basic Decimal Terminology
- **Decimal**: A number expressed in the base-ten system. Example: 0.25, which you read as "zero point two five".
- **Decimal Point**: A dot used to separate the whole number from the fraction in a decimal number. Example: In 3.14, the decimal point separates 3 and 14.
- **Whole Number Part**: The part of the decimal to the left of the decimal point. Example: In 7.89, 7 is the whole number part.
- **Fractional Part**: The part of the decimal to the right of the decimal point. Example: In 7.89, 89 is the fractional part.
- **Decimal Place**: The position of a number after the decimal point. Example: In 0.123, 1 is in the first decimal place, 2 is in the second, and 3 is in the third.
- **Ones:** The "ones" place is the first place to the left of the decimal point in a number, and it represents whole numbers from 0 to 9.
- **Tens**: The "tens" place is the second place to the left of the decimal point in a number, and it represents multiples of 10.
- **Tenths:** The first digit after the decimal point.
- **Hundreds:** The second digit after the decimal point.
- **Thousands:** The third digit after the decimal point.
- **Rounding**: The process of approximating a number to the nearest whole number or decimal place. Example: 0.56 rounded to the nearest whole number is 1.
