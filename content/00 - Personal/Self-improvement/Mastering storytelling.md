# The dance
There always needs to be some **conflict**. Between all major events in the story there needs to be a conflict which spices up the plot a little bit. This is achieved by using a lot of *but* and *therefore*.
# Rhythm
We need to change the pace a little bit, because otherwise it will feel bland. The sentences need to have a **different amount of words** in them, shorter sentences for better engagement and longer sentences for a better explanation.
# Tone
Speaking **to** someone and **with** someone are 2 different things. When possible, try to speak as if you were speaking to your close friend. Try to utilize 2nd person and common language when possible. The person must feel spoken to, not being sold something
# Direction
The end is the best place to start when writing a story. This is because we need a good ending to work ourselves into. As the last thing is usually what many people **remember the most**, it is crucial to have a good ending. The second most important line is the first one, as that is what people hear and either get hooked or not. Thirdly, just fill in the space in between.
# Story lenses
Talk about different things than most people do. If there is an event of some sort that everyone interprets the same way, try to look for some other meaning that you interpret in your own way.
# The hook
The first line must be as indicative and as descriptive as possible. Visual hooks are much more effective than audio hooks. That's why it is important to implement the visual aspect at the beginning where possible.
