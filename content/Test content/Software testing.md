**Software testing** is the act of checking whether [[Software]] satisfies expectations.

Software testing can provide objective, independent information about the [quality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business) "Quality (business)") of software and the [risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk "Risk") of its failure to a [user](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_(computing) "User (computing)") or sponsor.

Software testing can determine the [correctness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correctness_(computer_science) "Correctness (computer science)") of software for specific [scenarios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario_(computing) "Scenario (computing)") but cannot determine correctness for all scenarios.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing#cite_note-pan-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing#cite_note-Kaner2-3) It cannot find all [bugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug "Software bug").

Based on the criteria for measuring correctness from an [[oracle]] .wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_oracle "Test oracle"), software testing employs principles and mechanisms that might recognize a problem. Examples of oracles include [specifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification "Specification"), [contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_Contract "Design by Contract"),[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing#cite_note-4) comparable products, past versions of the same product, inferences about intended or expected purpose, user or customer expectations, relevant standards, and applicable laws.

Software testing is often dynamic in nature; running the software to verify actual output matches expected. It can also be static in nature; reviewing [code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code "Source code") and its associated [documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentation "Documentation").

Software testing is often used to answer the question: Does the software do what it is supposed to do and what it needs to do?

Information learned from software testing may be used to improve the process by which software is developed.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing#cite_note-kolawa-5): 41–43 

Software testing should follow a "pyramid" approach wherein most of your tests should be [unit tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_tests "Unit tests"), followed by [integration tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing "Integration testing") and finally [end-to-end (e2e) tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_testing "End-to-end testing")should have the lowest proportion.
