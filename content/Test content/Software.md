**Software** consists of [computer programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program "Computer program") that instruct the [execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_(computing) "Execution (computing)") of a [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software#cite_note-pis-p16-1) Software also includes design documents and specifications.

The history of software is closely tied to the development of digital computers in the mid-20th century. Early programs were written in the [machine language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_language "Machine language") specific to the hardware. The introduction of [high-level programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language "High-level programming language") in 1958 allowed for more human-readable instructions, making [software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development "Software development") easier and more portable across different [computer architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture "Computer architecture"). Software in a programming language is run through a [compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler "Compiler") or [interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing) "Interpreter (computing)") to [execute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_(computing) "Execution (computing)") on the architecture's hardware. Over time, software has become complex, owing to developments in [networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network"), [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_systems "Operating systems"), and [databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Databases "Databases").

Software can generally be categorized into two main types:

1. [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system"), which manage hardware resources and provide services for applications
2. [application software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software "Application software"), which performs specific tasks for users

The rise of [cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing "Cloud computing") has introduced the new software delivery model [Software as a Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_Service "Software as a Service") (SaaS). In SaaS, applications are hosted by a [provider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_service_provider "Application service provider") and [accessed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP "HTTP") over the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet").

The process of developing software involves several stages. The stages include [software design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design "Software design"), [programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming "Computer programming"), [testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing "Software testing"), [release](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle "Software release life cycle"), and [maintenance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_maintenance "Software maintenance"). [Software quality assurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_quality_assurance "Software quality assurance") and [security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security "Information security") are critical aspects of software development, as [bugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_bug "Computer bug") and [security vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computing) "Vulnerability (computing)") can lead to system failures and security breaches. Additionally, legal issues such as software licenses and intellectual property rights play a significant role in the distribution of software products.
